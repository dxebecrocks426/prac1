Dear Blockchain Developers,

We are excited to invite you to our Blockchain Development Excellence Bootcamp: Perpetual Futures DEX Integration, a 1-month (4-week) intensive program designed to identify and develop top-tier blockchain talent specializing in Solana smart contract development and high-performance settlement infrastructure for our growing team.

Bootcamp Overview
The GoQuant Blockchain Bootcamp focuses on building a production-ready decentralized perpetual futures exchange by integrating individual components into a complete, high-performance trading system. Each participant brings expertise from their assigned component - whether it's settlement infrastructure, position management, liquidation systems, oracle integration, collateral vaults, funding rate calculations, ephemeral vaults, or program upgrade systems. We are seeking dedicated blockchain developers with exceptional Rust and Solana programming skills, deep understanding of DeFi protocols, and passion for building secure, high-performance trading infrastructure.

Technical Focus Areas
This bootcamp will concentrate on integrating critical components of a perpetual futures DEX:

• Settlement Relayer & Batch Processing: High-throughput transaction batching with Merkle tree verification
• Position Management System: Leveraged positions with margin calculations and PnL tracking (up to 1000x leverage)
• Liquidation Engine: Real-time position monitoring and automatic liquidation system
• Ephemeral Vault System: Temporary session-based wallets with delegation for gasless trading
• Funding Rate Calculation System: Perpetual futures funding rate calculation with 1-second intervals and hourly payments
• Oracle Integration & Price Feeds: Multi-oracle price feed system with Pyth/Switchboard integration
• Collateral Vault Management: Non-custodial collateral vaults with SPL Token management
• Program Upgrade & Migration System: Safe protocol upgrades with governance and state migration

Participants will gain practical experience in:
• Solana program development using Rust and Anchor framework
• Building high-performance smart contracts for DeFi applications
• Implementing perpetual futures mechanics (funding rates, leverage, liquidations)
• Oracle integration patterns and price feed validation
• Transaction batching and settlement infrastructure
• PDA-based account management and cross-program invocations
• Security best practices for managing user funds non-custodially
• Performance optimization for high-frequency trading scenarios (100+ trades/second)
• Deploying and testing on Solana devnet/testnet/mainnet
• Building comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, and on-chain testing)

Program Structure & Progression
Week 1: Component integration planning and initial integration work
Week 2: Core integration development and inter-component communication
Week 3: Advanced integration features and end-to-end functionality
Week 4: Testing, optimization, and deployment preparation

Successful participants who demonstrate exceptional technical execution, collaborative problem-solving, and production-ready code quality will be selected to join our team as dedicated blockchain engineers, where you'll work on real-world DeFi applications and contribute directly to our product's growth.

Program Commitment
This intensive 1-month program requires a minimum dedication of 4-8 hours per day. Participants should be prepared for hands-on smart contract development, code reviews, performance optimization sessions, integration challenges, and comprehensive technical assessments throughout the program.

Selection Process
At the end of the bootcamp, candidates who demonstrate:
• Exceptional Rust and Solana programming skills with production-quality code
• Deep understanding of Solana's programming model (accounts, PDAs, CPIs, rent)
• Strong grasp of perpetual futures mechanics and DeFi protocol design
• Ability to build secure, high-performance smart contracts and settlement infrastructure
• Excellent problem-solving skills and optimization mindset
• Strong communication skills and collaborative development practices
• Proficiency in Anchor framework and Solana development best practices
• Experience with oracle integration and blockchain security patterns

Will be selected to join our team as dedicated blockchain engineers, where you'll work on real-world high-frequency trading applications and contribute directly to our product's growth on the blockchain infrastructure side.
